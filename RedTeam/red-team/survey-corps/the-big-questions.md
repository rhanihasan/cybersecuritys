# The Big Questions



## Big Question (Passing Data )

#### Understanding Data Flow in Web Applications

When approaching a web application, a fundamental question arises: **How does the application handle and pass data?** This is crucial for effective testing and uncovering various vulnerabilities. Let's explore the basics and delve into additional details.

#### 1. **Data Passing Methods:**

* **HTTP Query Parameters:**
  * Example: `http://example.com/resource?parameter1=value&parameter2=value`
* **RESTful Format:**
  * Example: `https://example.com/route/resource/sub-resources/...`

#### 2. **Identifying Data Flow:**

* **Command:**
  * Use browser developer tools (Network tab) or tools like Burp Suite to observe HTTP requests.
  * Example: [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

#### 3. **HTTP Query Parameters:**

* **Understanding Structure:**
  * Analyze URLs to identify parameters and values.
* **Command:**
  * Manually inspect URLs or use Burp Suite's Target tab for a comprehensive view.

#### 4. **RESTful Format:**

* **Resource Hierarchy:**
  * Comprehend the structure of resources and sub-resources in RESTful URLs.
* **Command:**
  * Explore API routes and endpoints through manual inspection or tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.

#### 5. **Testing Approach:**

* **Payload Injection:**
  * Tailor your testing approach based on where data is passed.
* **Command:**
  * Utilize tools like OWASP ZAP or custom scripts for injecting payloads.
  * Example: [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)

#### 6. **Bug Categories:**

* **Common Vulnerabilities:**
  * Injection, XSS, SSRF, and other bugs may manifest differently based on data passing methods.
* **Command:**
  * Explore each category using targeted testing methodologies.

#### 7. **Additional Details:**

* **Dynamic Analysis:**
  * Use dynamic analysis tools to intercept and modify data in transit.
  * Example: [Mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/)

#### 8. **Documentation and Swagger:**

* **Understanding API Structure:**
  * Refer to API documentation or Swagger UI if available.
  * Example: [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)

## Big Question (Users)

#### Unraveling User Interaction in Web Applications

In dissecting a web application, a pivotal query emerges: How and where does the application manage user-related interactions?&#x20;

understanding how users (youself and other users) are referenced and where in the application is povotal to finding serveral bugs classess, most specifically access, authorization , logic and information disclosure bugs

This inquiry lays the foundation for identifying a spectrum of bugs, ranging from access and authorization issues to logic and information disclosure vulnerabilities.

As we embark on the exploration of web applications, a pivotal question arises: **Does the site incorporate multi-tenancy or feature distinct user levels?** This inquiry serves as a compass, guiding the trajectory of our testing methodologies, particularly in the realm of authorization and access bug identification.

#### 1. User Landscape Examination:

* **Multi-Tenancy Evaluation:**
  * Ascertain if the application supports multiple tenants or user groups.
* **User Level Analysis:**
  * Identify different user levels, such as administrators, regular users, or guests.

#### 2. Impact on Testing Strategies:

* **Authorization Testing Tailoring:**
  * Adjust authorization testing approaches based on the presence of multi-tenancy or diverse user levels.
* **Access Control Adaptation:**
  * Customize access control testing to align with the intricacies of user privileges.

#### 3. Authorization Bug Classes:

* **User-Level Access Flaws:**
  * Prioritize testing scenarios where user roles intersect with critical functionalities.
* **Multi-Tenancy Vulnerabilities:**
  * Investigate how multi-tenancy might introduce unique authorization challenges.

#### 4. User-Centric Bug Discovery:

* **Testing Scenarios:**
  * Craft test scenarios that mimic user interactions at different levels.
  * **Tenant-Specific Testing:**
    * Focus on areas where the presence of multi-tenancy introduces nuances in user access.

#### 5. Threat Model Interplay: Uniqueness Matters

The exploration of user dynamics intertwines with another significant inquiry: **Does the site boast a distinctive threat model?** Beyond the conventional Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, the existence of unique elements like API keys or application data for doxing necessitates a nuanced testing approach.

#### 6. Identifying Unique Threat Vectors:

* **API Key Scrutiny:**
  * Investigate the presence and handling of API keys within the application.
* **Specialized Data Attention:**
  * Target testing efforts towards data categories beyond standard PII.

#### 7. Tailoring Testing for Specialized Data:

* **Doxing-Related Testing:**
  * If the application holds data susceptible to doxing, focus on testing scenarios that safeguard against unauthorized access.
* **API Key Exposure Scenarios:**
  * Devise tests to evaluate how the application protects and manages the exposure of API keys.
