## Advanced Web Security Testing Techniques

### XSS (Methodology)

**Ashar Javed's Methodology:** Ashar Javed provides a comprehensive methodology for XSS testing. His approach covers various aspects and provides a structured way to identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities. Explore his methodology for a thorough understanding.

### XSS (Blind)

**BXSS Hunter:** BXSS Hunter is a hosted solution that simplifies blind XSS testing. Its user-friendly interface and effective reporting make it an excellent choice for discovering and exploiting blind XSS vulnerabilities. Check out BXSS Hunter for an easy and efficient blind XSS hunting experience.

### XSS (Parameters)

**List of Potential XSS Parameters:** Be cautious; XSS can lurk anywhere. Here's a list of common parameters where XSS might be found:

* q
* s
* search
* id
* lang
* keywords
* year
* view
* email
* type
* name
* p
* month
* image
* list type
* url
* terms
* key
* login
* begindate
* enddate

### IDOR (Authorize)

**InsiderPHD's IDOR Visual Overview:** InsiderPHD offers a visual overview of IDOR authorization, providing insights and a simplified understanding of this crucial testing area. Visual aids can be valuable for learning.

### IDOR (Parameters)

* id
* user
* account
* number
* order
* ne
* doc
* key
* email
* group
* profile
* edit
* REST numeric paths

### SSRF (Spray and Pray)

**SSRF Payloads:** Spraying and praying for SSRF vulnerabilities can involve injecting payload through various parameters. An example:

```bash
cat allurls.txt | grep "=" | qsreplace http://burpcollaborator > ssrf.txt
cat ssrf.txt | httpx -fr
```

This approach iterates through URLs, replacing parameters with the Burp Collaborator URL, and then probes for SSRF.

**SSRF (Metadata URLs):** Discover potential SSRF vulnerabilities by exploring metadata URLs. While security measures are improving, some services may still have exploitable vulnerabilities.

### XXE (Payloads)

**Payloads for XXE Testing:** Explore the PayloadsAllTheThings repository on GitHub for a variety of XXE payloads. This resource categorizes payloads based on XXE types, providing a valuable reference for testing.

### SQLi (Unit Ghauri)

**Unit Ghauri for SQLi Testing:** Unit Ghauri is a tool that handles blind and time-based SQL injection exploits with a focus on WAF evasion. It brings advancements to SQL injection testing beyond traditional tools like SQLmap.

### SQLi (Parameters)

* id
* select
* report
* role
* update
* query
* name
* user
* sort
* where
* search
* params
* process
* row
* view
* table
* rom
* sel
* results
* sleep
* fetch
* order
* keyword
* column
* field
* delete
* string
* number
* filter

### COTS (WordPress)

**WordPress Scanning with WPScan:** WPScan remains a powerful tool for scanning WordPress websites. It helps identify vulnerabilities specific to WordPress instances. Note that there are limitations on scan frequency with the free version, and alternatives are being explored.
