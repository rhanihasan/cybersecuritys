I've explained each method in simple terms for beginners. For every method, you'll find an easy-to-understand reason why and how we use it.

Explore this guide and develop your own recon approach. Continuously experiment to discover what works best for you.

I'm too a beginner in this field and have tried my best to explain the right concepts. If you think any of the content is wrongly explained, I am always open to listening to you.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank
