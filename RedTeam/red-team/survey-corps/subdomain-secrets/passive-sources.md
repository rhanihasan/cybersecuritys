#### What is passive subdomain enumeration? <a href="#what-is-passive-subdomain-enumeration" id="what-is-passive-subdomain-enumeration"></a>

> Passive subdomain enumeration is a method to search for domain data using databases from services like

### Whois Lookup

**Purpose:** Find information about who owns a domain.\
**How it works:** Domain owners provide contact details upon registration, stored in a public database.\
**Usage:** `whois example.com`

**Its help to gather the information based on domain.**

**How the whois get the information of Domian because when the target Regester with domain vendors it must provide some information/details to authority. And they will available this information public as they use this method of advertisement unless and until buy the premium subscription**

**Register whois server is where the whois get the information of domain.**

{% code title="Syntax: whois" %}
```
whois <name><.in><.com><.etc>
```
{% endcode %}

[**Automated shodan (shosubgo)**](https://github.com/incogbyte/shosubgo)

* for sticky subdomain discovery using subdomain &#x20;
* A smart hacker might wonder why to use this tool when Amass already has similar features. They might notice that specialized tools for Shodan and GitHub searches often produce more results by 3-4% because they focus on those areas.
* After getting the domains and karma output it can be flirted out by CHATGTP cut script

> get the results form Crt.sh and query here on shodan
>
> > ssl "company inc" 200
> >
> > > 200 is http 200 response.

1.  Retrieve results from Crt.sh and query them on Shodan:

    ```bash
    crtsh "your_domain_here" | shodan search
    ```
2.  Search for SSL-certified websites belonging to "Company Inc" with HTTP 200 response:

    ```bash
    shodan ssl "Company Inc" port:443,80 http.status:200
    ```
3.  Look for login functionality in Shodan:

    ```bash
    shodan search "login" 
    ```
4.  Perform a new search for SSL certificates with a specific Common Name (CN) and HTTP 200 response:

    ```bash
    shodan ssl.cert.subject.CN:"example.com" port:443,80 http.status:200
    ```

    Note: Place the domain within quotation marks, not the organization name.
5.  Filter results in Shodan with HTTP and explore every prompt provided:

    ```bash
    shodan search "your_filter_here" --expand
    ```
6.  In GitHub, utilize the domain name and additional filters like "example.com" for sensitive information such as passwords, secrets, tokens, and more:

    ```bash
    github-dork -u "example.com" -s "passwd|pwd|pw|secret|token" 
    ```

    Note: Ensure you have the necessary tools like `github-dork` installed for GitHub dorking.

### [**Amass**](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass)  **:**- The Swiss Army Knife for Subdomain Enumeration

**Installation:**

```bash
# Set up Go environment (if not done already)
# Instructions: https://golang.org/doc/install
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v3/...@master
```

**Configuration:**

* Amass uses a configuration file located at `$HOME/.config/amass/config.ini`.
* Configure API keys in the file (e.g., AlienVault, BinaryEdge) for passive DNS data.
* \[Example Config File]\(link to your config file)

**Running Amass:**

```bash
# Example command
amass enum -passive -d example.com -config config.ini -o output.txt

# Explanation:
# - `enum`: Perform DNS enumeration
# - `passive`: Collect information passively through configured data sources
# - `config`: Specify the location of the config file (default: $HOME/.config/amass/config.ini)
```

**Tip:** To verify API key setup, use the command: `amass enum -list -config config.ini`

**What to do with this subnet?**

* _More subdomains mean more IP\_ADDR. More probability increased, more computer more attack chances it will give the attack successful chances to increase,_
* _Target it using service from different company, like the above example netflix is using services from Cloudflare_
* _So, these are in Public IP-Range It can be assets._

### [Subdomainer](https://github.com/Cyber-Guy1/Subdomainer)

* its an automated tool for domain and subdmain gathering&#x20;
* Its uses multiple repo like Amass,subfinder,gobuster and more.

## Recursive Enumeration



This technique involves further exploration of subdomains using tools like Amass, Subfinder, Assetfinder on the already discovered subdomains.&#x20;

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * You should have a list of subdomains stored in a file called "subdomains.txt."
   * API keys should be set up, but be cautious as this technique may exhaust your API querying quota.
2. **Execution Steps:** a) **Identify Frequent Second-Level Domains:**
   * Read the subdomains from the file.
   * Find the top 10 most frequently occurring Second-Level Domain names using tools like cut, sort, rev, uniq. b) **Identify Frequent Third-Level Domains:**
   * Find the top 10 most frequently occurring Third-Level domains.
   * This step uses similar tools to identify and list the most common Third-Level domains.
3. **Run Passive Subdomain Enumeration:**
   * Execute passive subdomain enumeration on the identified Second-Level and Third-Level domain names using tools like Amass, Subfinder, Assetfinder, Findomain.
   * Append the results to a file called "passive\_recursive.txt."
4. **Use Puredns to DNS Resolve:**
   * After obtaining a list of domain names, run Puredns to DNS resolve them and find the alive subdomains.
5. **Execution Script:**
   * Replace "subdomains.txt" with the actual filename of your subdomains list.
   * The provided script uses various command-line tools and scripts like subfinder, assetfinder, amass, and findomain.

```bash
go install -v github.com/tomnomnom/anew@latest

subdomain_list="subdomains.txt"

for sub in $(
  ( cat $subdomain_list | rev | cut -d '.' -f 3,2,1 | rev | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep -v '1 ' | head -n 10 &&
    cat subdomains.txt | rev | cut -d '.' -f 4,3,2,1 | rev | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep -v '1 ' | head -n 10 ) |
    sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' | cut -d ' ' -f 2
); do
  subfinder -d $sub -silent -max-time 2 | anew -q passive_recursive.txt
  assetfinder --subs-only $sub | anew -q passive_recursive.txt
  amass enum -timeout 2 -passive -d $sub | anew -q passive_recursive.txt
  findomain --quiet -t $sub | anew -q passive_recursive.txt
  puredns -i passive_recursive.txt -r results.txt

done
```

### [**Findomain**](https://github.com/Findomain/Findomain)**:**

* **Purpose:** Finds subdomains for a website.
*   **Command:**

* **Usage:** [Intelligence X](https://intelx.io/)
  * Search by email, domain, or IP for information.

### **Project Sonar by Rapid7:**

* **What is it?** Project Sonar is a research project by Rapid7 that scans the entire internet. They share valuable datasets for free, containing lots of information about domains.
* **How to use it?** You can follow their guide here to explore these datasets.

### **Crobat API for Rapid7 Sonar Dataset**:

* **What is it?** Crobat is a tool built on the Rapid7 Sonar dataset. It's like a search engine for subdomains.
*   **How to use it?**

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```bash
    # Install Crobat tool using Go
    go get github.com/cgboal/sonarsearch/cmd/crobat
    # Query the Crobat API for subdomains of example.com and save the results to output.txt
    crobat -s example.com > output.txt
    ```
    {% endcode %}

#### Subdomain Extraction from Crobat Output:

* **What is it?** After using Crobat, this command helps filter and organize the results.
*   **How to use it?**

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```bash
    # Extracts subdomains from files with the ".apexdomain.com" pattern, removes duplicates, and saves to output.txt
    cat *.txt | grep ".apexdomain.com" | grep -oP "(?<=[).*(?=\])" | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -v "*" | sort -u

    Examplation
    cat *.txt: Reads content from all text files.
    grep ".apexdomain.com": Filters lines containing ".apexdomain.com".
    grep -oP "(?<=[).*(?=\])": Extracts content between square brackets.
    tr ' ' '\n': Transforms spaces into newlines.
    grep -v "*": Excludes lines with asterisks.
    sort -u: Sorts and removes duplicates.
    ```
    {% endcode %}

    exiftool /path/to/filename.pdf
    ```

    * `/path/to/filename.pdf`: Path to the file you want to inspect.

&#x20;it can adapt them to your specific needs by replacing example domains, file paths, etc.





## DNS BruteForcing











Nuclei

* Its it has template, like Metasploit has Auxiliary for scanning script, those script identifies another information against the target. It a template base tasks execution.

Installation : Sudo apt install nuclei

\#nudlie

When the nuclei start its first download default-nuclei template which is YAM base.

Argument –u

\#nuclie –u \[target-ipaddr]

\-t to define the templates

\-ss will scan auto scanning

\-sandbox for safe execution

\-nt for new templates

Download the custom templates from github or create one using yml and more.
