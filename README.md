This repository contains my work on cyber security and ethical hacking.

## About Me

I am a devoted student with a deep passion for cyber security and ethical hacking. My areas of interest encompass penetration testing, networking, and server security.

I enjoy learning about how to test computer systems to make sure they are secure, how computer networks work, and how to keep servers safe. I have earned many certificates in these topics already, but I am eager to expand my knowledge further in this domain.
