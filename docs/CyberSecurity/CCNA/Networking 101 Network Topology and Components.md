# Network 101 Topology & Components

## **Network Topology** 

### **What Is network Topology ?** 

- **Topology** means **Diagram** ==>  **Network Diagram**.

## **Types of Topology’s** 

### **Point to Point Topology’s.**

:::note
Its a point to point connection.
:::


## **Bus Topology**

|---|


|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|Bus topology is cheap,  |Files doesn't has secret (it broadcasts data to all)|
|Use a single coaxial cable which connects all ,including nodes.| There is not backup when the cable is damage |

#### **BNC Creator : Bayonet Neill–Concelman**
 
#### **BNC Connector** 
- It was used to connect multiple devices .
- It was use as a switch at that time.

#### **Coaxial Cable**
- It was used to connect devices.
- It is a single wire cable that can sent or received data at one at the time.

## **Ring Topology**
### **What is Ring Topology**

- Every Device has exactly two neighbouring devices for communication purpose.

|---|

|Pros | Cons|
|---|---|
|Its has a backup ways to destination in networks |Its doesnt have BNC Terminator. & ts has struggle to add new Pc’s because ring Wire has to be the connected wires, It has BNC connector.|

## **Star Topology** 

#### **What & Why Star Topology**

- All the computer connects with the help of Hub.
- BNC to RJ45 Converter
- It a connector between BNC to RJ45, It helps to connect two different type of topologies.

|---|

|Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| If one PC is down  & cable is physically damaged So the  others are not effected. | It has half Duplex [Data flow one ways]|



## **Hybrid Topology**

### **What & Why Hybrid Topology**

- It a mixer of two or more topology & combination of topology it can be connected by BNC to RJ45 Convertor.

|---|
|Cons|
|It effects the speed of data, Its half-Duplex |



## **Mesh Topology**

### **What & Why Mesh topology** 

- It used when two or more branches at different places but dont want ant third partly involved so connect to both with cables or VPN 

|Half & Full Mesh Topology|
|---|
|![Half-mesh-topology](./img/Network%20101%20Topolgy%20and%20%20components/half_mesh_topology.png)|
|![full-mesh-topology](./img/Network%20101%20Topolgy%20and%20%20components/full_mesh_topoplogy.png)|


|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|Full Duplex in Full Mash Topology| Half Mesh can travel only one direction Half Duplex. It need licences form government to apply. Maintainces is costly.|
