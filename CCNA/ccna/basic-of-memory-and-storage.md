# Basic of Memory & Storage

### Introduction

> <mark style="color:blue;">**Memory is used to stored data.**</mark>

> <mark style="color:blue;">**There are two types of Memory. Which is Internal & External Memory.**</mark>



### Internal Memory

#### ROM (Read Only Memory)

* A small chip design to complete the particular task.

{% hint style="info" %}
Like a Washing Machine has the timer it will work it the timer setoff.

Like every time a phone is powerd on it display the logo on the company.
{% endhint %}

#### Types of ROM



**EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)**

* ROM that can be reprogramed or erasable.

**EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)**

* ROM that can be reprogrammed or erasable through electrically.

#### RAM (Random Access Memory)

* The Hard drive retries the file and provides to CPU (central processing unit) and the CPU will pass on to RAM for resources.
* Cache is present between RAM & CPU, which result faster than ROM.
* The information is lost when the computer lost its power supply.

#### Types of RAM (Random Access Memory)

SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)

* It types of cache, it expensive and faster.
* It manages power supply from the computer.
* It doesn't need multiply power supply.&#x20;
* The information stored in SRAM won't delete after power cut from computer. It will be deleted manually by the user.

DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)

* It like a normal RAM, it called Dynamic RAM because it gets refreshing continuously every few seconds.
* It does need multiply power supply; the memory stored information will be removed when Power supply is shutdown (computer is shutdown).

Types of DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memory)

SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory)

* The older RAM could not be synced with system and unable to generate logs.
* This would also pose difficulties to see ' how fast the RAM is performing, Hence the SDRAM was created and named Synchronized Dynamic Random Access Memory. It gives information how long the application service is running.
* SDRAM can't synced with system time & doesn't handle heavy application.
* SDRAM Speed is '133 MHZ'

RDRAM (Rambus Dynamic Random Access Memory)

* RDRAM is created by Private Sector, the speed is up to 1 GHz.
* RDRAM is capable of handling heavy application in 1990s.

DDRRAM (Double Data Rate Random Access Memory)

* Its the up gradated version of SDRAM which mean its faster and compatible.
* Its has version from DDR1 - DDR6 (DDR6 is known has GDDR6).
* Mostly Phones are used by DDR RAM.

{% hint style="info" %}
To check the RAM Vendor >> Right Click on Computer PC >> Manage >> Device Manager.
{% endhint %}

> Laptops have different number of slots where ram can be inserted. These slots are called **DIMM** slots. You can check the number of **DIMM** slots in your laptop by going to task manager.&#x20;

**Types of DDRAM**

DDR 1 was created by IBM[^1].

| Model  | Details                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DDR1   | it can be up to 2GB RAM.                                                                                                                                             |
| LIDDR1 | <p><strong>Date: 1998</strong> <br><strong>Voltage: 25/2.6</strong> <br><strong>Bandwidth Speed: 1600</strong></p>                                                   |
| DDR2   | <p><strong>2 x 2 equals 4 GB of RAM.</strong> <br><strong>The date is 2003,</strong> <br><strong>the voltage is 1.8, and the bandwidth speed is 2133.</strong></p>   |
| DDR3   | <p><strong>2 x 2 x 2 equals 8 GB RAM.</strong> <br><strong>The date is 2007, voltage is 1.5/1.35, and</strong> <br><strong>the bandwidth speed is 2666.</strong></p> |
| DDR4   | <p><strong>Date: 2014</strong> <br><strong>Voltage: 1.2/1.05</strong> <br><strong>Bandwidth Speed: 3200</strong></p>                                                 |
| DDR6   | 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64gb ram.                                                                                                                                    |



#### CPU (Central Processing Units)

* A **CPU** has multiplied Cores. Cores are called the brain .&#x20;
* Cores type: Single core, Dual core , Quad Core, Octa core, **Hexa** core, **Deca** core.

#### NIC Card (Network Interface Controller)

* NIC is also known as Network Adapter.
* Its a Network Hardware that connect computer to network.

#### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

* **GPU** is used in a wide range of apps including graphics and videos rendering. Although they best known for their capabilities in opening.



## **External Memory**

### **HardDrive**

* First created by IBM. Had a capacity of 5MB.&#x20;
* All data is stored here.



Types of Hard drive.

HDD ( Hard Disk Drive)

* If the disk in it is cracked or bent, the data won't be recovered&#x20;
* Takes more power and requires more space.&#x20;

SDD (Solid State Drive)

* Very compact and fast.
* Data is recoverable.&#x20;

> **Note :- These harddrives are connected to SATA drive. (pata >> sata) pata was used before sata and was slower. Sata : serial sata.**&#x20;



#### **LPDDR** <a href="#lpddr" id="lpddr"></a>

* **LPDDR** is mostly used for PHONE

#### **DIMM** <a href="#dimm" id="dimm"></a>

* It is useful in laptop, Attach RAM inside of it
* DIMM is memory module comprised of a small-side circuit board that holds a series of memory called DRAM

### **Cables** <a href="#cables" id="cables"></a>

#### **PATA Cable** <a href="#pata-cable" id="pata-cable"></a>

* It was first cable in industry to transfer data from **HardDrive** to ram (up to 1GB)

#### **SATA Cable** <a href="#sata-cable" id="sata-cable"></a>

* It was invented after PATA Cable , it is also use to share data form HDD to RAM (like up to 2GB)

#### **M2** <a href="#m2" id="m2"></a>

* It is also a data cable and more efficient than SATA Cable(up to 4GB).

#### **NVME** <a href="#nvme" id="nvme"></a>

* Non-Volatile Memory Express
* which is all in newly and lasted cable used to transfer data from **HardDrive** to RAM.
* It was first cable in industry to transfer data from **HardDrive**to #**RAM**(up to 1GB)
