# Fundamentals Of Memory

## **What is Memory**

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Its Stored Data.**</mark>

### **Types of Memory**

* There are two Types of **Memory** which is **Internal** And **External** Memory.



## **Internal Memory**

### **ROM**

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Read Only Memory**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
* Small chip that doesn’t have a lot of space and does the task that it is programmed to do.
* It has a **memory** of **10mb, 12mb** etc.&#x20;

> **Example: washing machine contains rom that tells it to set a timer and do different cycles for different amount of time, our phone shows the company name whenever it is switched on etc.**

#### **Types of ROM**

**EPROM**

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Erasable programmable read only memory.**</mark>
* **ROM** that can be removed and erased and reprogrammed.&#x20;

**EEPROM**

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Electrically erasable read only memory.**</mark>
* **ROM** that can electrically erased and reprogrammed.

### **RAM**

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Read Only Memory.**</mark>
* **RAM** gives the **CPU** the files required for processing after retrieving it from the hard drive.
* Cache is present between ram and <mark style="color:orange;">**CPU**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
* It contains most used applications/data.
* It is faster than <mark style="color:orange;">**RAM**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
* The information stored in this type of memory is lost when the power supply to the PC is switch off.

#### **Types of RAM**

* **Static**
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**Static Random Access Memory**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**SRAM**</mark>**,** It is a type of cache. Expensive and very fast. Power is supplied from the machine.&#x20;
  * It doesn't need multiply power supply.&#x20;
  * The information doesn’t deleted unit the user want to delete&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**SRAM**</mark> is a type of cache.
* **Dynamic**
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**Dynamic Random Access Memory**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
  * **DRAM is also Known as DDR**.
  * Works as normal ram. It is called dynamic because it keeps on getting refreshed continuously in a few seconds.
  * It needs multiple times of power supply.
  * The information got deleted when PC is shutdown.

**Types of DRAM**

* **SDRAM**
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory.**</mark>&#x20;
  * Older **RAMs** could not be synced with the system and hence could not generate logs.&#x20;
  * This would also pose difficulties to see how fast it is performing, Hence SDRAM was created. It stands for Synchronized DRAM.&#x20;
  * It gives information of how long a service runs. \*\*Speed: 133 MHz \*\*
  * **SDRAM** can't sync with system time and doesn’t work in heavy apps.
* **RDRAM**
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**Rambus Dynamic Random-access Memory.**</mark>
  * Private company create this RDRAM.&#x20;
  * **Speed: 1GHz.**
  * **RDRAM** can take heavy task in 1990s.

### **DDR RAM**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Double Data Rate**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
* Updated **SDRAM** that was faster.
* Most phones have **DDR4 nowadays**.&#x20;
* **DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5, DDR6(also known as GDDR6)**&#x20;
* To check vendors, we can right click on this pc, manage, device manager.&#x20;

> Laptops have different number of slots where ram can be inserted. These slots are called **DIMM** slots. You can check the number of **DIMM** slots in your laptop by going to task manager.&#x20;

**Types of DDRAM**

* DDR 1 was created By IBM[^1].

|   **DDR**  | **Details**                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **DDR1**  | **It can put 2gb RAM.**                                                                                                                                              |
| **LiDDR1** | <p><strong>Date: 1998</strong> <br><strong>Voltage: 25/2.6</strong> <br><strong>Bandwidth Speed: 1600</strong></p>                                                   |
|  **DDR2**  | <p><strong>2 x 2 equals 4 GB of RAM.</strong> <br><strong>The date is 2003,</strong> <br><strong>the voltage is 1.8, and the bandwidth speed is 2133.</strong></p>   |
|  **DDR3**  | <p><strong>2 x 2 x 2 equals 8 GB RAM.</strong> <br><strong>The date is 2007, voltage is 1.5/1.35, and</strong> <br><strong>the bandwidth speed is 2666.</strong></p> |
|  **DDR4**  | <p><strong>Date: 2014</strong> <br><strong>Voltage: 1.2/1.05</strong> <br><strong>Bandwidth Speed: 3200</strong></p>                                                 |
|  **DDR6**  | 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64gb ram.                                                                                                                                    |

### **CPU**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Central Processing Unit.**</mark>&#x20;
* A **CPU** has multiply Cores. Cores are called the brain .&#x20;
* Cores type : Single core, Dual core , Quad Core , Octa core, **Hexa** core , **Deca** core.&#x20;

### **NIC Card**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Network Interface Controller/Network Adopter.**</mark>&#x20;
* NIC is a computer hardware component that connect a computer to a computer network.&#x20;
* NIC has MAC-Address Not computer has MAC-Address.

### **GPU**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Graphics Processing Unit.**</mark>
* **GPU** is used in a wide range of apps including graphics and videos rendering. Although they best known for their capabilities in opening.

## **External Memory**

### **HardDrive**

* First created by IBM. Had a capacity of 5MB.&#x20;
* All data is stored here.

**Types of HardDrive**

### **HDD**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Hard Disk Drive**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
* If the disk in it is cracked or bent, the data won't be recovered&#x20;
* Takes more power and requires more space.&#x20;

### **SDD**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Solid State Drive.**</mark>&#x20;
* Very compact and fast.
* Data is recoverable.&#x20;

> **Note :- These harddrives are connected to SATA drive. (pata --> sata) pata was used before sata and was slower. Sata : serial sata.**&#x20;

### **LPDDR**

* <mark style="color:orange;">**LPDDR**</mark> is mostly used for PHONE&#x20;

### **DIMM**

* It is useful in laptop, Attach RAM inside of it&#x20;
* DIMM is memory module comprised of a small-side circuit board that holds a series of memory called DRAM&#x20;

## **Cables**

### **PATA Cable**&#x20;

* It was first cable in industry to transfer data from **HardDrive** to ram (up to 1GB)&#x20;

### **SATA Cable**&#x20;

* It was invented after PATA Cable , it is also use to share data form HDD to RAM (like up to 2GB)&#x20;

### **M2**&#x20;

* It is also a data cable and more efficient than SATA Cable(up to 4GB).&#x20;

### **NVME**&#x20;

* Non-Volatile Memory Express
* which is all in newly and lasted cable used to transfer data from **HardDrive** to RAM.&#x20;
* It was first cable in industry to transfer data from **HardDrive**to #**RAM**(up to 1GB)&#x20;
